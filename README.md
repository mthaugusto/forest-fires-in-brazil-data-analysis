## Forest Fires Analysis in Brazil

This project performs an analysis of forest fires recorded in Brazil between the years 1998 and 2017, using data available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gustavomodelli/forest-fires-in-brazil) and from the [Brazilian government's open data portal](http://dados.gov.br/dataset/sistema-nacional-de-informacoes-florestais-snif). The dataset was provided by Lu√≠s Gustavo Modelli.

### Objective
